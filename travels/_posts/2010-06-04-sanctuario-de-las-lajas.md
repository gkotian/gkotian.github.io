I had stayed back in the nothing-much-to-do-in town of Ipiales just to visit the
Sanctuario de Las Lajas, and when I saw the majestic church the next morning, I
was glad that I had stayed. The church was constructed on the side of a mountain
with a bridge over a deep gorge with a river flowing underneath.
