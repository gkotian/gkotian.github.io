I don't get what it is with everyone in Siem Reap talking about sunrises and
sunsets all the time. Juli is apparently a big fan of sunrises and sunsets, and
after hearing people going on about how amazing the sunset at Phnom Bakhen is,
she just had to go and check it out for herself. Since I had nothing better to
do anyway, I agreed to go along. The Phnom Bakhen temple is on a small hill and
involves a short trek to the top. By the time we got there, the place was packed
with people. After a long wait, I finally scored some places to sit; and saw the
sun go down.

Juli, Talita, Paul & I met for dinner later in the evening, after which we said
goodbye to Paul. He would be going to Bangkok next, then to India in a few
months, and would continue travelling at least until October.

Juli, Talita & I then went to a place called Molly Malone's bar where Ryan was
playing tonight. Back at the guesthouse, I said goodbye to Juli who was catching
an early morning bus to Bangkok, would travel for a few more months in South
East Asia before heading back home to Germany.
