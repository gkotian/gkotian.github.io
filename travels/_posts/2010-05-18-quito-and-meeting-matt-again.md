For the past several weeks, I had been surrounded by people and had quite
forgotten that I was actually on this trip all by myself. That realization
struck suddenly when I disembarked in the bus terminal at Quito, and I felt
momentarily confused and overwhelmed, much like [on first landing in Ecuador]({{

I had the advantage of at least understanding some common Spanish words and
being able to make simple sentences. After walking about the bus terminal for
half an hour, I walked up to the information desk and picked up a couple of
maps, one of Quito and another of Ecuador itself.

It turned out that I was currently at Terminal Quitumbe, at the southern end of
Quito. This was one of the two main bus terminals of the city (the other one
being Terminal Carcelén at the northern end). I would need to take a trolley bus
(El Trole) from here to get into the heart of the city.

The bus ride to the historic city centre (Centro Historico) took about 45
minutes. Once there I started walking around looking for an internet shop so
that I could look for a nearby hostel. Instead, I stumbled upon some sort of a
street theatre in progress and spent a long time just watching them perform
though I didn't really understand much.

Soon after, I found an internet cafe and saw that Matt had left a message on
Facebook about the hostel he was staying in. It was called Hostel Guayanga and
was quite easy to locate. I reached there, checked myself into the same dorm
room as Matt, and located him on the roof of The Secret Garden, a partner hostel
across the street.

Over a few beers, we spent some time catching up on our respective weekends.
