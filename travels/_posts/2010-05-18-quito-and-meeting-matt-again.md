For the past several weeks, I had been surrounded by people and had quite
forgotten that I was actually on this trip all by myself. That realization
struck suddenly when I disembarked in the bus terminal at Quito, and I felt
momentarily confused and overwhelmed, much like [on first landing in Ecuador]({{

I had the advantage of at least understanding some common Spanish words and
being able to make simple sentences. After walking about the bus terminal for
half an hour, I walked up to the information desk and picked up a couple of maps
- one of Quito and another one of Ecuador itself.

It turned out that I was currently at Terminal Quitumbe, at the southern end of
Quito. This was one of the two main bus terminals of the city (the other one
being Terminal Carcel√©n at the northern end). I would need to take a trolley bus
(El Trole) from here to get into the heart of the city.

The bus ride to the historic city centre (Centro Historico) took about 45
minutes. Once there I started walking around looking for an internet shop so
that I could look for a nearby hostel. Instead, I stumbled upon some sort of a
street theatre in progress and spent a long time just watching them perform
though I didn't really understand much.

Soon after, I found an internet cafe and saw that Matt had left a message on
Facebook about the hostel he was staying in. It was called Hostel Guayanga and
was quite easy to locate. I reached there, checked myself into the same dorm
room as Matt, and located him on the roof of The Secret Garden, a partner hostel
across the street.

Over a few beers, we spent some time catching up on our respective weekends.
