title: To Istanbul with love

I landed at Istanbul just after midnight and Jana was already waiting for me. We
decided to hang around inside the airport and leave when the bus service starts
in the morning. Vitek, the Polish guy, who had flown in on the same flight from
Sharjah also joined us and we had dinner together. A police officer saw us
eating chocolates, and came over to ask if he could have some. We were happy to
share and soon there was a small army of cops around us.

At about 4 am, we said goodbye to Vitek and went off to search for Taskin and
Sabriye's place in Istanbul. I had contacted them via couchsurfing and they had
agreed to host us for the next 2 days.

In the 10 days or so that I was in Turkey, I did not blog at all. We were in
Istanbul for the first three days, then went to Sile (pronounced "sheelay") and
Agva (pronounced "awa") by the Black Sea and then came back to Istanbul. We had
a wonderful time in Turkey. It is such a beautiful country, with such amazing
people. I guess it's going to be very hard for another place to better this
experience.

For now, I leave you with the pictures.
