Athens, where Divya's college was, turned out to be a nice university town full
of students. I have always enjoyed being in such places, and Divya went out of
her way to keep me from getting bored.

We walked around the campus, went club hopping on the weekly college night,
watched a movie, visited the nearby quaint town called Helen and walked up to
the Anna Ruby falls. I had had a good time in Athens, and before I knew it, it
was time for me to go.

My plan was to rent a car, drive all the way south to Keywest - Florida, which
was the southern-most tip of the continental United States; and then back north
to Miami. On Sunday morning, Divya drove me to the closest Avis car rental
place, but they were closed as it was the Easter Sunday. It was of course, the
Breakdown Gang in action, and I was reminded of my [failed attempts at leaving
Delhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url travels/2010-03-16-the-best-laid-plans %})
and riding to the Wagah border.

So we came back home, and I took Divya's Honda CR-V for a drive to downtown
Atlanta. Despite having a GPS device, I got lost as usual and took three hours
to get to Atlanta. Downtown Atlanta has so many one-way streets, that it's hard
for a normal person to not make a mistake. But in my case, it just meant that it
was disaster waiting to happen. The psychotic woman sitting inside the small GPS
unit suddenly woke up for no apparent reason and told me to turn left. So I
turned left. In less than a microsecond I knew that I was going the wrong way on
a one way street. Thanks to my wonderful luck, I almost drove straight into a
policeman on a motorcycle. I first heard the cop shouting, "Hey!", and then
heard his loud siren go off. What followed were the bright revolving lights -
the stuff of every driver's nightmares.

Like a good boy, I stopped by the side of the road while the cop turned around,
rode down the road a little and parked horizontally in the middle of the road in
order to block the oncoming traffic. Then he bellowed, "Turn around" at the top
of voice, which I quietly obeyed. I started driving slowly expecting him to stop
me and give me a ticket. But he rode up next to me and shouted, "Pay attention
to the signs man" before riding away. I'm sure he didn't hear me say I'm sorry.
I barely heard it myself because my throat had gone completely dry :D

I heaved a sigh of relief, drove into the parking lot of a supermarket, parked
there for a good 15 minutes to clear my head, and then just drove back home -
not once exceeding the speed limit.
