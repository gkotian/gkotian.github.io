The next morning, however, was time to say goodbye to my new friends. They had
bought tickets for the longer version of the cruise and were now off to
somewhere else while I was on my way back to Hanoi.

It was evening by the time I made it back to Hanoi. Prit had put me in touch
with Pedro & Jelly, his friends from the time they all studied together in
Germany.

After dinner with one of their German friends, they took me to their large and
beautiful home. They were very hospitable and I gave me an entire room to
myself, along with a spare set of keys to the house.
