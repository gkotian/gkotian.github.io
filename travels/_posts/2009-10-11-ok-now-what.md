If someone ever tells you that a world trip is easier said than done, then trust
me, it would be one of the biggest understatements you'll ever hear.

The amount of planning and research that goes into such a project is phenomenal.
It is such a daunting task, that one can get discouraged easily. There's a lot
to be done; and like all big projects, things have to be taken care of
one-at-a-time without losing focus of the big goals. The main areas that I need
to work on are:

- Get this website up, and ensure that it's updated regularly
- Buy/borrow travel-the-world books and find time to read them
- Look for potential sponsors
- Get my finances in order (because I'll have to continue to pay my home loan
  even when I'm not earning)
- Plan a tentative route
- Research about places along the route and choose the one's that simply cannot
  be missed
- Start applying for visas
- Arrange for all vaccinations needed
- Start contacting couchsurfers or look for other accommodation
- Start looking for volunteering work/part-time jobs
- Start looking for Spanish language classes (both here and in South America)
- Start looking for conveyance options

        Mexico, cover Central America, the Caribbean Islands, then several
        countries in South America and finally end up in Brazil. Looking back
        upon it now, what a pipe-dream that was! But one has got to dream big,
        right?" %}
