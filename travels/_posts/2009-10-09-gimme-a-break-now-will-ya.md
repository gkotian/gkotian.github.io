excerpt: So what do I want to do next?
---
I have always loved to travel, just like my parents. Owing to them, I have been to many popular touristy places all over India. We've gone as far north as Kashmir, as far south as Kanyakumari and as far east as Sikkim. I think Mumbai is probably the "westest" that I've been to. For one of our vacations, We even left the mainland and spent a week in the Andaman Islands.

Since the Indian currency is not all that strong, we could never afford to travel abroad; but I was lucky to get two international work assignments in the United States which fulfilled my long-cherished dream of travelling overseas. However, as of the writing of this post, my parents have never travelled anywhere outside India - and I intend to fix that as soon as I can.

Coming back to where I left off in the previous post, I was in New Delhi with my buddies trying to decide what I could/should do after the 31st of December 2009 (my last day of work at my current employer). The way I saw it, my options were:
- find another IT job
- work for an NGO
- work as a volunteer at couchsurfing
- become a social worker in a developing country
- start a new venture
- go for higher studies

What I did not want to do was "find another IT job". I had been in the IT industry for more than 5 years, and for now, I had had enough. What I needed most was a break from the corporate life, and I decided that's exactly what I would get in 2010.
