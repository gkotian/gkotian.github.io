Matt woke me up at 4 in the morning since he was flying back home to Canada. As
I usually do when saying goodbye, I gave him a postcard (addressed both to him
and his brother Colin, who'd also been a volunteer at Katitawa but had left
earlier). We also exchanged reading recommendations. He recommended "Jitterbug
Perfume", while I recommended "Shantaram". After that we said goodbye, and he
left.

Later in the morning, I went to the Colombian embassy to ask for a tourist visa.
They were surprised to see an Indian tourist asking for a visa in Quito, but
were not dismissive like the staff of the Peruvian embassy. They asked me a lot
of questions about how I came to be there, and once satisfied, asked me to
submit all the required documents. Unfortunately I didn't have everything they
wanted, and I wouldn't have time to arrange for everything before the documents
submission window for the day expired. So I had to come back the next day, but
at least this time there was hope that I'd get the visa!

For now, I leave you with what I found painted on one of the walls in my hostel:

    Nobody can take away from you...
    The dances you have danced,
    The food you have eaten,
    Or the travels you have traveled
