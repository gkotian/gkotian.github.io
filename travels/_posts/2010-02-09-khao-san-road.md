Our first stop in Bangkok was Khao San Road. Vinay had told me a lot about this
backpacker friendly place packed with tourists, and it sure did not dissapoint.

There were people from all over the world milling about all over the street. We
found a decent place to stay, and stepped out to explore. We walked up and down
the street several times and seemed to discover new things every time. There
were interesting things to eat, interesting shop fronts to peer into,
interesting people to look at, and of course interesting unsolicited offers to
reject.

It was evening soon, and Khao San was beginning to really wake up. As the night
progressed, the "interesting" factor of Khao San kept rising as our capacity to
appreciate all of it kept diminishing.

By late next morning when we finally woke up (how did we even get back to our
room?!!), hungover and both extremely hungry and thirsty, no one could remember
all details of the previous evening. Over mouthfuls of whatever was on the
table, we pieced together our exploits of the night and as you'd expect, decided
to repeat it all over again. And again.

We had agreed early on one rule : whatever happens in Bangkok stays in Bangkok.
Details have been deliberately skipped in keeping with this rule.
