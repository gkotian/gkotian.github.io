[The usurper of my bed the other night]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
travels/2010-06-10-cali-the-salsa-capital-of-the-world %}) was an American girl
of Peruvian descent called Kathy. Apparently, she had heard such good things
about Colombia that when she was in Otavalo, she just couldn't resist the
temptation to take a short 3 day detour north into Colombia (but only up to
Cali), before heading back into Ecuador. Kathy and I got along quite well, and I
invited her to come clubbing with us.

That evening we went to a nightclub called [Tin Tin
Deo](http://www.tintindeo.com), because we'd heard that it really comes alive on
Thursday nights. That piece of information turned out to be spot-on. Tin Tin Deo
was exactly the kind of place I had pictured when I first thought of a nightclub
in South America. There were mostly locals in the club, and boy, did they know
how to dance!!! I was happy to simply let myself be mesmerised by the incredible
leading skills of the men, and the superbly graceful moves of the ladies.

Back in Motorola, when I was still employed, a bunch of us Motorolans had
practiced Salsa for a few weeks under the guidance of
programmer-cum-salsa-master [Eslyn](https://www.facebook.com/Ezzlyn). Although
we'd had a wonderful time practicing, and had put up a decent performance on
stage, we would've been shamed into oblivion had we tried to show off in Tin Tin
Deo.
