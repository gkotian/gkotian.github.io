excerpt: Could I really dare to dream?
---

I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 week vacation in North India. During the first week I
was at Dehradun at my friend's wedding along with my other friends, and in the
second week I went on a solo motorcycle ride through a portion of the Himalayas
before riding the motorcycle back to New Delhi.

It was during this trip that I decided to take a break to travel a bit in the
first half of 2010. Back in Bangalore, during one of our usual chats over chai,
my flatmate Vinay convinced me that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
and I had to make the most of it.

Traveling around the world was always something other "lucky" people did. Having
hosted many many travelers via couchsurfing in Bangalore, and being an active
member of the Bangalore couchsurfing community, I had met and interacted with
heaps of these courageous, adventurous, reckless, unconventional, carefree
people; and here I was with a golden opportunity to apply all those fancy
adjectives to myself.
