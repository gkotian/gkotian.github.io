excerpt: It was a cold, snowy night in Chicago (sometime in February 2008) when I went to watch an NBA game with my colleagues - Gowdish & Ramesh. After the game, I remember saying to them, "There are two kinds of people in the world – those who have watched an NBA game, and those who haven't".

It was a cold, snowy February night in Chicago when I went to watch a basketball
game with my colleagues - Gowdish & Ramesh. After the game, I remember saying to
them,<br>
_"There are two kinds of people in the world – those who have watched an NBA
game, and those who haven't"_

The next year, I did a tandem skydive, so I had to issue a new statement,<br>
_"There are two kinds of people in the world – those who have jumped out of an
airplane, and those who haven't"_

Today, I have to issue a third statement,<br>
_"There are two kinds of people in the world – those who have fired an AK-47
machine gun, and those who haven't"_

I had arranged for a motorbike taxi to come and pick me up from my guesthouse
early in the morning, to take me to the firing range. Once I got there, I was
shown a menu card (I wasn't allowed to photograph the menu). Each page of the
menu had the picture of a gun, a brief description, the country where the gun
was invented, whether it was a single shot or automatic, and the cost of
firing it.

One could choose from a range of handguns, revolvers, sub-machine guns, machine
guns, a grenade launcher and even a rocket launcher (bazooka). If I could have
afforded the steep price tag of 350 USD for firing the rocket launcher, I might
have done that. But I stuck to my second favourite item on the menu – the AK-47
for 40 USD. I was also told me that for a price, any target – from a duck to a
cow – could be arranged. Not being someone who would kill a living thing for
sport, I happily settled for a paper target.

Next I was given an army jacket and thick headphones, and led to a narrow tunnel
kind of structure with a table and chair on the near end and the target on the
far end. The table had a small attachment where the nozzle of the gun had to be
placed.

To start with, the gun was in single shot mode, but it refused to fire the first
few times because something was stuck (maybe the safety was on, I have no idea).
When it actually did fire, I realised what a powerful weapon it was. I had
mounted myself pretty firmly on the chair, and was expecting a strong recoil,
but it still shook me pretty hard. Not recommended for persons with weak chests
or shoulders. After firing about 5 single shots, I changed it to automatic mode,
and proceeded to obliterate my target.
