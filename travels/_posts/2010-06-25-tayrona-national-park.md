The Spaniard & I had planned to go to Parque Tayrona together, and we had agreed
to meet at the lobby of the hostel at 7 am sharp. For some reason, he said it
was very important to leave so early and he could not afford to leave any later
than 7:30 am. I had told him not to rely on me, and to just get going if I don't
show up by 7:15 am. That was good thinking on my part because it was 9:00 am by
the time I awoke. By the time I got ready and got to the reception, I was told
that the spaniard had waited for me for a while, and then left. I told the
friendly man at the reception that I would also be going to Tayrona National
Park and would be back the next day. He told me that I would need to walk a bit
to reach the coast and offered to store my backpack at the hostel so I wouldn't
need to carry it all the way and back. I was grateful for that and took some
bare essentials in my small backpack and got on my way.

It was already 11:00 am by the time I finally reached the entrance to Tayrona
National Park. I paid the entrance fee of 34000 Colombian pesos for
non-Colombians after which a mini-bus drove me further into the park and dropped
me off after about 15 minutes near a path that went into the jungle. It was a
little unnerving in the beginning to walk into a forest all by myself, even if
it was a sunny morning and the weather was perfect. But after walking for a bit,
I began to relax and enjoy the nature around me. The jungle was beautiful and
dense and never actually felt intimidating from within. One couldn't lose one's
way as the path was clear throughout, probably due to being well trodded by
other visitors. One thing, however, was slowing me down big time and turning out
to be a huge pain in the neck. The pair of shorts I was wearing was extremely
loose and I had to constantly keep pulling it up every few metres. I just had to
do something about this or else I would lose my mind. Earlier in the morning,
when I left my large backpack at the hostel, I also left my belt in it so I now
needed to improvise. After some looking around, I found a suitable looking
creeper, chopped off a portion of it, and tied it around my waist. That did the
trick! I could finally walk normally. It must have been a weird sight as some
people I saw who were headed in the opposite direction gave me strange looks.

I walked for almost an hour and finally made it to the sea. I was at a beach
called Arricefes. Here I went to the first place where some hammocks had been
stretched outside and rented one for myself for the night. The place had a
bookshelf where one could leave a book and borrow another one. I didn't have a
book to leave, so I just borrowed one - I know, not exactly playing by the rules
but I promised myself I would pass on that book to someone else once I was done
with it. The book was called "The Other Hand" by author Chris Cleave. Then I
went for a stroll along the beach. Presently, I came upon a board that said "No
trespassing beyond this point". But the rocks behind the board looked absolutely
beautiful so I trespassed beyond that point anyway. There was a massive boulder
there, and I found myself a nice shady spot next to it and started reading my
newly acquired book.

I must have drifted off to a peaceful sleep, as I woke up with a start on
hearing the sound of a helicopter flying at low altitude. The chopper was flying
straight towards me and it was low enough that I could clearly see the faces of
the military men within. They only stared at me as they flew past and I only
stared back. They had huge machine guns, so I dared not wave lest they mistake
my book for a rocket launcher. I suddenly remembered the "No trespassing" sign
that I'd seen earlier and thought I might get in trouble if I stuck around here.
So I hurried off from where I had come, and found myself another amazing spot to
sit and read. This place also had the added bonus that I could observe the crabs
on the beach.

Soon after sunset, I went back to the place where I had rented the hammock. I
had been foolish to not have brought any insect repellent along. The mosquitoes
were already giving me a hard time now, and I knew at night it would only get
much worse. There were two Dutch girls who were kind enough to let me use some
of their insect repellent cream and that helped a lot. Unfortunately, its effect
wore off after a couple of hours. Moreover, I wasn't accustomed to sleeping in
hammocks - up until that point, I had only spent a few minutes in one, let alone
an entire night. Suffice to say, I had a terrible, terrible night.
