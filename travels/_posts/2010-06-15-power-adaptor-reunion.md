title: Power adaptor reunion

My hostel in Popayan had found someone headed to Cali, and they had agreed to
take what I really really hoped was my power adaptor with them. I had been given
a name - Vanessa - along with the name of the hostel where she would be staying.
Luckily for me, the hostel was quite close to mine so I could just walk there.

But I am an idiot. I should've brought something for her, at the very least some
chocolate, but the thought never crossed my mind. I reached her hostel, but she
had gone out. However, she had given the power adaptor to the people in the
reception. I was so overjoyed on discovering that it was indeed my power adaptor
that I even did not leave her a thank you note. Yeah, I really am an idiot.

Dear Vanessa and the nice people of the hostel in Popayan, I'm sorry I couldn't
thank you in person, but if you ever happen to read this, please know that I
really really appreciate it.

Although I was in Cali for a week; I did not see much of the city at all. Most
days were spent sleeping, and most nights were spent dancing. At other times, I
would either be looking for a power adaptor, watching football in the hostel
lobby or playing a card game called shithead with my other hostel mates. But I
didn't really regret it, as on the whole I'd had a good time in Cali. My only
regret was not having had a chance to say goodbye to Pedro when he left. I don't
know when we'll bump into each other next, hopefully during the Football World
Cup in Brazil in 2014.
