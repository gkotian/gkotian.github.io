El Panecillo is a small bread-shaped hill on which stands the gigantic statue of
The Virgin Mary overlooking Quito, and supposedly protecting it from the
volcanoes. Besides being an enormous structure, it is probably the only place
where the Madonna is depicted in a dancing pose, and where she has wings.

I wanted to get up there to see the statue from up close from the very first
time I saw it from the city below, but I heard that walking up there wasn't a
good idea. The road to get up the hill passed through some rough neighbourhoods
and tourists getting mugged was not unheard of. Having been pick-pocketed only a
few hours earlier, I wasn't keen on tempting fate again, and opted for a taxi to
take me up there and back down again.

The journey to the top was comfortable and uneventful. At the statue, one can
climb up to the balcony from where one can get great views of the expansive city
of Quito.

Once back at the hostel, I checked out of the room, picked up all my belongings
and set off for Mitad del Mundo (which translates to the middle of the world).
It is a well known fact that the Equator passes through Ecuador (which
incidentally is what the country is named after), and the Mitad del Mundo was
built with the intention of being located bang on the Equator.

The intent may have been admirable, but the calculations were disgraceful. The
monument ended up being constructed an embarrassing 240 metres off the real
Latitude 0 0' 0". Despite that, the monument is still quite impressive and draws
a lot of tourists who like to have their photos taken straddling the fake
equatorial line.

After spending some time walking around the monument, I headed over to the
nearby Museo Inti-Ã‘an - the site of the real equator. I would highly recommend a
visit to this museum to check out some pretty cool experiments that can
allegedly only be carried out on the Equator.

The most interesting experiment was about the [Coriolis
Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force){:target="_blank"} carried
out using a basin of water. It was amazing to see how the water drains straight
downwards without any spiralling when the basin was kept on the Equator, drains
in a clockwise or anti-clockwise manner when moved only a few metres to the
south or north respectively.

My initial plan had been to carry on to Otavalo from Mitad del Mundo. Looking at
the map, it seemed like a reasonable plan as Mitad del Mundo seemed to be just a
little lesser than half the way from Quito to Otavalo. But once at Mitad del
Mundo, I found out that there are no direct buses from there to Otavalo. One
wishing to go to Otavalo has to go back south to Quito and then get another bus
going north to Otavalo.

Since it was getting late, and since Quito is notorious for its after-dusk
crimes, I thought it would be safest to spend the night in Mitad del Mundo
itself. But there seemed to be only a single hostel in the area and they didn't
have any free rooms. With no other suitable alternative, I took a bus back to
Quito and made a beeline to my previous hostel. The staff, whom I had bid
farewell to earlier in the day were surprised to see me back. They said my bed
in the dormitory was still unoccupied, so I took the same bed once again.
