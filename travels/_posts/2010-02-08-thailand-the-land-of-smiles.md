OJ & I landed in Mumbai at around 1 am. VMK and Kini had come to the domestic
airport to meet us. From there, all of us got into a cab to go to the
international airport. On the way, VMK suddenly remembered that we needed
to stock up on Indian cigarettes and OJ suddenly remembered that we needed to
stock up on [Rajnigandha](http://rajnigandha.com). Did you note how I said "we"
needed to stock up? I said so because that is exactly how the need was
described, even though the need was in reality restricted to where its awareness
had sprung from. So off we went in search of a paan shop in the middle of the
night. Thank heavens we found one on the way for if we hadn't, I'm almost
certain that we would have roamed the entire city in search of a shop to buy
these indispensable items from, even at the cost of missing our flight.

The flight took off at 5.30 am Indian time, and landed at Suvarnabhumi
International airport in Bangkok at 10.30 am local time. The visa on arrival
system was fairly simple and to encourage tourism, Thailand had waived off the
visa fees till March this year. The only thing you needed to show to be granted
a visa was a ticket out of Thailand. VMK, Kini & OJ had booked return flights so
they had everything they needed, but I didn’t. I was planning on crossing over
into Cambodia by road, so I had no ticket to show. I was hoping that the visa
officer would accept my explanation and grant me a visa as well, but that was
not to be. He insisted on a flight ticket out of Thailand, so I was left with no
choice but to buy one at the airport itself.

Animesh, a friend from Bangalore and [an experienced traveller
himself](https://desibackpacker.wordpress.com) had advised me that in situations
such as these, one should just buy a ticket with any of the airlines destined
anywhere out of the current country. One should also buy cancellable tickets
(which are priced a lot higher), and once you have the visa you're after, just
go ahead and cancel them. It takes a while until the money gets refunded to you,
but at least you don't incur a large cancellation fee.

So OJ & I went looking for a ticketing counter, while Kini and VMK waited with
our bags. The only ticketing counter available was that of Thai airways, and
there were no cancellable tickets available. Booking a ticket and later
canceling it would cost me at least 2000 THB, and I didn't want to spend so much
for no reason. So we found an internet centre at the airport itself, and
"manufactured" a return ticket.

The visa officer was satisfied with my "ticket" and gave me the visa. All of us
were now authorised to travel around the land of smiles for the next 15 days.
