All of us had had a good time yesterday, so we decided to head back to the same
bar. No sooner had we all settled around one of the large tables that we noticed
the same local girls from the previous evening, but this time in the arms of a
different bunch of foreign tourists. While some quick hellos were exchanged, I
couldn't figure out know who was more embarrassed, the girls or our "lucky"
pals. The rest of us "unlucky" guys could barely contain our laughter.

The awkwardness of those early moments made sure that the rest of the evening
wasn't as great as the previous one.
