Mitchell & Amy were volunteering only for a week, and would be leaving on
Saturday morning, so we planned a farewell party on Friday night. It turned out
to be blast with some Salsa lessons from yours truly thrown into the mix. The
irony of an Indian guy teaching Salsa steps to South Americans in South America
was not lost on anyone.

But the Indian guy couldn't cook anything Indian. Thankfully, Eddie came to the
rescue here, and made some great sabji with chapattis. The irony of a Kiwi
making Indian dishes (and that too, so very tasty) was also not lost on anyone.

This time it was Matt who was at the receiving end of Nicolas' "big fight at
midnight". Every once in a while one could hear a loud "I will kill you man!"
from the Frenchman. Midnight did come, and the fight did take place; but Matt
was simply too strong. It was only with Nicolas & I together wrestling with
the Canadian that it seemed like an evenly matched contest. When we finally
broke apart, Matt was wearing my shirt, I was wearing Nicolas' shirt and Matt's
shirt had been thrown to the pig.
