Saying goodbye is never easy, but it has to be done.

I wrote postcards for everyone at the hostel, and Nicolas wrote one for me in
return. We clicked a last few snaps together, and also some stupid ones before I
left. I cannot even put into words the truly amazing times I had spent with the
volunteers of Katitawa. My time here would surely remain the highlight of the
South American part of my trip, and probably some of the most memorable times of
my life.

On the way, I made a quick stop at the library and slipped a postcard under the
door for Robert. I congratulated him for his efforts to make the lives of the
poor people in this remote corner of the world just a little bit better, and
also thanked him for having given me the opportunity to do my part. Soon after
that, I was on a bus that would take me to the capital city of Ecuador - Quito.
