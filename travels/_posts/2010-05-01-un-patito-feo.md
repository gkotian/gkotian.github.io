That means "An ugly duckling".

The 30th of April was going to be the last working day at Katitawa for Ed,
Tanya, Lizzy, Emma, Damir, Dotahn & Emmily. On their last day, we were planning
to act out the ugly duckling (in Spanish) as a skit for the kids. The previous
evening, Ed wrote the script and took up the job of narrating it. We rehearsed
about 3 to 4 times, with me playing the role of one of the swans.

I had exactly 3 lines to say:

    "No eres un patito feo" ==> You're not an ugly duckling
    "Mira su reflecion en la agua" ==> Look at your reflection in the water
    "Mire... mas fuerte" ==> Look, more carefully

The next morning, we gave a stellar performance at the school and the kids just
loved it. I displayed my impeccable acting skills and said my lines with gusto,
which made me an instant favourite with the crowd. Dear reader, if you are a big
shot in Bollywood, look no further; get in touch with me and we'll make millions
together.

[Here](http://emmtahn.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/project-sky-final-week){:target="_blank"}
is Emmily & Dotahn's full write-up of their final week at Katitawa.

The volunteers working at the library had done a stupendous job with the
theatre. Since they had put in so much time and effort in making the theatre
look so good, they didn't have time in the end to write a script for the puppet
show. But Rupinho wrote a small storyline in Kichwa for the popular Kichwa
legend of the Condor who fell in love. Some of the kids in school were in charge
of handling the puppets, and despite rehearsing only a few times, they put up a
good show in the evening. Yours truly was in charge of lighting, and as expected
goofed up a few times (but that was mainly because the damn light switch would
give me a small electric shock every now and then).
