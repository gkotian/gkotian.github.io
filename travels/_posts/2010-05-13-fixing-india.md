Some past volunteers of Katitawa had painted a beautiful large map of the world
on one of the walls of the foyer of the library. But India had not been drawn
correctly. Kashmir had not been shown entirely as a part of India, the
north-eastern states were a totally different color, and the Andaman & Nicobar
islands weren't even shown. I had wanted to fix all these mistakes ever since I
had spotted them, but simply couldn't remember to do it when I was at the
library.

But one day, at long last, I finally remembered, found some old unused paint
lying around and fixed all the mistakes once and for all. If only I could fix
the problems on the ground just as easily with a few strokes of my paint brush
:(
