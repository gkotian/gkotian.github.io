I knew that I always had a home in OJ’s place whenever I was in New Delhi, but
this time it turned out to be even better. OJ’s parents had gone to Rajasthan to
attend a wedding, so we had the entire house to ourselves. We also had OJ's
motorcycle at our disposal (the same one with which I had made [my solo trip
through Uttarakhand]({% post_url 2009-10-10-a-germ-of-an-idea %})).

In the five days we spent in Delhi, we traveled almost all over the huge city
with no clear idea of where exactly we were going.

Some of the things that I did manage to do were:

- Visited [Delhi Kannada
  School](https://www.facebook.com/Delhi-kannada-school-130157357095627) where I
  had studied between 1987 and 1991. I met the current principal of the school,
  who knew who the principal was when I was there more than 20 years ago.
  Although not much had changed, the school and its playground seemed much much
  smaller than I remembered.

- Visit the flat where we used to live then. The current owner of the flat was
  really nice, and when he heard that I used to live there 20 years ago, he
  actually invited me in and let me look around :)

- After visits to numerous offices around the city (which were not easy to
  locate), I finally figured out where to arrange for a duplicate birth
  certificate for my brother. My brother had been born in Delhi but my parents
  had misplaced his birth certificate and that was often turning out to be a
  problem. I did apply for a duplicate, but the clerk told me a long story about
  how he cannot issue birth certificates because of some software problem. But
  then if I paid him a bribe, it could be done. I refused to pay, so I didn't
  get the certificate.

- Met the super-wealthy family of a girl with whom my parents wanted to arrange
  my marriage

- Checked out portions of the [Jawaharlal Nehru University
  (JNU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University,_Delhi),
  where Jana wanted to apply for a job as a German teacher

- Ate a lot of Rajma-Chawal, Chole-Phulke and Chana-Bhatura

- Drank a shitload of chai

I wanted to get myself injected with a lot of vaccinations while in Delhi, as I
had been told that this would be a pre-requisite to obtain several visas, but
that completely slipped my mind. Thank goodness for that. Never did the subject
of vaccinations come up in any visa related matter, and I am thankful I was
saved both the hassle and the associated risks.

Finally, after a week in New Delhi, it was time for Jana to go back to Varanasi
and for me to fly to Mumbai. I was super-sad to part with Jana but that was how
it had to be. A few hours later, OJ and I boarded our flight to Mumbai.
