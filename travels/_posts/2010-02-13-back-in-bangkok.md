The next morning we took the ferry out of Koh Samui, went to the Surat Thani
airport and caught a flight to Bangkok. It was already evening by the time we
landed, and not having any good ideas about what to do next, took a taxi to the
one place we knew well - Khao San Road, only to have the greatest disappointment
of our trip :(

As soon as the taxi slowed to a stop near our destination, the driver hurriedly
asked us to get out. He couldn't wait for us to finish paying, and practically
pushed us out of the cab. He said he couldn't stop there as the police would fine
him. This was despite the fact there were several taxies standing right in front
of us. This should have raised alarm bells in our heads, but we just assumed he
was an eccentric guy and ignored him. The taxi sped away into the night almost
as soon as we were out of it.

It was only then that Kini realised his camera was missing. Kini was sitting in
the passenger seat next to the driver with the camera in his pocket. It had most
likely fallen out and the wily cab driver had noticed it. In hindsight, his
eagerness to get rid of us before any of us thought about the camera made
perfect sense.

We went to the closest police station and reported the theft, but without a
licence plate number, there wasn't much the police could do. The camera was
lost, and with it almost ALL our Thailand snaps. Kini’s camera was the primary
one, with VMK's camera being used only once in a while. This meant that more
than 90% of our total pictures were gone for good.

We decided to drown our sorrows in one of the many establishments that the
neighbourhood of Khao San road offers for those looking to drown their sorrows
in, and as usual somehow found ourselves in our beds the next morning.

By now, we had had enough of Bangkok’s nightlife so we let Kini persuade us to
go shopping at the [Chatuchak weekend
market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatuchak_Weekend_Market). This turned out
to be a really good idea, as it was a whole new side of Bangkok that we had no
idea about. A lot of things were bought at the market, which meant a lot of
re-shuffling of our bags was needed. The guys also agreed to take several of my
belongings back with them to India so that I wouldn't need to carry anything
that I didn't need.

Late in the evening, we walked to the main road, from where the others would hop
onto a taxi to the airport. We clicked a few last snaps together, and after a
big round of hugs and slaps on the back and words of encouragement, the guys got
into a cab and were gone. I was all alone for the first time since the start of
my trip.

I had decided to stay in Bangkok for a few more days in order to apply for a
visa to Mexico. Through couchsurfing, I had found someone who was willing to
host me for a couple of nights, so I picked up my backpack, and got into one of
the local Bangkok buses that would take me to my host's place. My host, Tomi,
turned out to be a nice guy from Indonesia. As it so happens, he's also totally
new in Bangkok, and had just managed to find a room to rent. He was having me as
a guest on just his second day in his new home.
