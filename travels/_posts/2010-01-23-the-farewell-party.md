excerpt: On the way back from Tirupati, I sent SMSes to as many people as I could inviting them for my farewell party that evening. It was almost 9 pm by the time we got home, and some of the guests were there already. But not everyone could make it at such short notice, and moreover since it was a weekday. But nevertheless, we had a good time, and I said my goodbyes to all at around 3 am so that I could get at least an hour to pack. I was done packing by around 4 am, and by 5 am Prit & I were ready to leave.

On the way back from Tirupati, I sent SMSes to as many people as I could
inviting them for my farewell party that evening. It was almost 9 pm by the time
we got home, and some of the guests were there already. But not everyone could
make it at such short notice, and moreover since it was a weekday. But
nevertheless, we had a good time, and I said my goodbyes to all at around 3 am
so that I could get at least an hour to pack. I was done packing by around 4 am,
and by 5 am Prit & I were ready to leave.

Adi was awake already, and I woke Shaarad up just before leaving. A quick
handshake, a quick hug, and that was it. I was going to miss living in this
house. I had had an amazing time here over the last 10 months, and I owed it in
a large way to my super chilled-out flatmates.
