excerpt: It was a warm summer morning in New Delhi when I got a call from my supervisor at work. He sounded grim when he said, "I have some bad news for you, the company has announced the next set of lay-offs, and your job is getting affected. You'll be with us for only 6 more months".

It was a warm summer morning in New Delhi when I got a call from my supervisor at work. He sounded grim when he said, "I have some bad news for you, the company has announced the next set of lay-offs, and your job is getting affected. You'll be with us for only 6 more months".

I had come from Bangalore to New Delhi on a 2 week vacation, mainly to attend a close friend's wedding at Dehradun. To be told that you're getting laid-off on the first day of a well-deserved vacation was a setback, but not entirely unexpected. The mobile devices division of my company - a large Fortune 500 organization employing thousands of people worldwide - hadn't been profitable for over a year now, and the series of mediocre products in the pipeline was nothing to write home about. To add insult to injury, a global financial crisis had set in and jobs being made redundant (a hitherto unheard of situation in India) was becoming all-too-common.

It was a consolation to be with some of my best buddies when I got the news, and I could easily confide in them. Truth be told, they were more dejected over this development than I was. In the back of my mind, I felt that the lay-off may in reality be a blessing-in-disguise. I was deep within my comfort zone with a well-paying job that challenged me little while still affording me a good lifestyle. I had gotten lazy living this relaxed life for about 5 years now, and would have continued for God-alone-knows-how-much-longer had it not been for this external "agitation".

So now I had to rethink what I wanted to do next, but thankfully I had 6 more months to decide!!
