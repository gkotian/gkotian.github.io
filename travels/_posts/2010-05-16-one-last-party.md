Sunday, the 16th of May 2010 was going to be my last day in Salasaca, so
preparations were underway (to be read as rum was bought) for a final party on
Saturday night. It so happened that a big community celebration was going to
happen in Salasaca centre on the same night. Were the Salasacans so glad to hear
of my departure that they had decided to celebrate? I'll never know.

The evening started out with Connect-4, with all of us trying different types of
variations to make the challenging game even more challenging. At some point, we
had a Connect-4 tournament which yours truly won in style. Having already
established myself as the indisputable champion of Connect-4, I showed the
others what a big cheater I could be if I wanted to :)

Finally when we were down our last 5 litres of Cuba libre; we took the rum and
headed to the city centre to join the celebrations there. On the way, we spotted
another party and thought we would stop by there on the way back. Once in the
city centre, things got really wild. We joined a group of local boys and took
turns taking shots of their local liquor, and also tried the different types of
"fresh and hot" alcohol being brewed on the carts.

On the way back, we did stop at the party midway between the city centre and the
hostel, but neither the others nor I could remember how we got there, or how
long we stayed, or how we got back home. Despite the large gaps in memory, my
last night in Salasaca was one that none of us would be forgetting for a long
time to come!
