            The year 2010 marked a defining period in my life. It was my year of travel.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started this blog at the beginning of that year when I set off on
            my adventures. When my savings ran out, I had to come back home and
            find a job again. That meant two things: my daily commute no longer
            qualified as "travelling", and a full-time job left me no time to
            write. So, at this point, it seems unlikely that newer posts will
            appear on this page, but as Forrest Gump would say...

            For now, I leave you, dear reader, with this...
