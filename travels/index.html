    <p>
        2010 was the year that changed everything. Against the grain of
        tradition and expectations, I decided it was my year to see the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started this blog in the nervous months leading up to my departure -
        when I decided I had to go "come what may."
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">
        <img src="/assets/backpacker.jpg" alt="Travels" style="width: 75%; height: auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        At the time, taking a gap year to travel was practically unheard of in
        India. My extended family was convinced I'd lost my mind. They did
        everything they could to try and dissuade me. I knew they meant well,
        but I also knew that backing down would leave me with a lifelong regret.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">
        <img src="/assets/placeholder_1200x200.png" alt="Travels" style="width: 75%; height: auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        Eventually, when my savings ran out, I had to come back home and
        find a job again. That meant two things:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>my daily commute no longer qualified as "travelling", and</li>
        <li>a full-time job left me no time to write.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So, at this point, it seems unlikely that new posts will appear on this
        page, but as Forrest Gump would say...
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5em 0;">
        <img src="/assets/placeholder_1200x200.png" alt="Travels" style="width: 75%; height: auto;"/>
    </div>
    <p>
        For now, dear reader, I leave you with this...
    </p>
</div>

<div id="posts_list">
    {% assign sorted_posts = site.categories.travels | sort: 'date' %}
    {% for post in sorted_posts %}
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">
            <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }} :</span>
            <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </p>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
