Hi, I'm Gautam.

I build software for a living and travel to stay sane.

Some other trivia about me (in no particular order):

- I have a tendency to fall down Wikipedia rabbit holes regularly.
- My browser has had over a hundred open tabs for years. I'll probably never read them, but I have an irrational fear of losing them all.
- I went from burning toast to actually impressing dinner guests. Growth is possible.
- I don't own a television, and I think that both amazes and disappoints my parents.
- Most people call me Googie. That's spelled with an `i` and not an `l`, and yes, it predates the search engine. If you ply me with a sufficient quantity of beer, I might even tell you why.
- I can't see a dog-eared book without fixing it. It's a compulsion.
- I've spent twenty years in Vim, mostly because it took that long to figure out how to exit. I'm not leaving now for your editor.
- I can out-eat most people at a buffet. Somehow my metabolism hasn't caught on yet.
- I play football ([the real kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football){:target="_blank"}) and I'm a decent defender - which mostly just means I'm good at getting in the way.
- I used to invent games as a bored kid in the pre-internet era. It was that or stare at the wall.
- I'm usually the quiet one in the room. Not being mysterious, just listening mostly.
- I genuinely enjoy public speaking, which apparently makes me [a statistical anomaly](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death){:target="_blank"}.
- I learned to inline skate when I turned 40 because childhood me never got the chance. Turns out gravity hits harder at 40, and stopping on skates is roughly as difficult as exiting Vim.
- I'm currently learning to swim properly - because 'not drowning' doesn't really count.
- I enjoy cutting out pictures in magazines to make collages. I just wish my kids did too, so I could make them do it and take all the credit.
- I really like to ski - it would help if I was any good at it.
