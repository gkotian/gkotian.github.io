Hi, I am Gautam.

I love building software and exploring the world.

Some other trivia about me (in no particular order):

- I read a lot of articles on Wikipedia [on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis) [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majid_Majidi) [very](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcairn_Islands) [wide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku) [range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_telepathy) [of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) [topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Memory_Processing).
