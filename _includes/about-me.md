Hi, I am Gautam Kotian.

I am passionately interested in creating amazing software and travelling!
I live in Berlin, Germany and work at [Sociomantic Labs GmbH](http://www.sociomantic.com), where we
are constantly striving to improve your online browsing experience.

Some other trivia about me (in no particular order):
