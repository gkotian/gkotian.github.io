did nothing much at home, played basketball in the evenings, burnt papad, firealarm rang, started tidying up the place in case the firemen show up, some guys asked for cricket in the evening

Once back from Canton, we had to return our Forester :( Once OJ left for work every morning, there was nothing much for me to do.
