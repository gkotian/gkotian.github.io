The rest of the week was spent in doing nothing but my “housewife” chores as usual.

On Saturday, some of OJ’s colleagues were going to the Pittsburgh zoo. I am no big supporter of zoos and wasn’t eager to look at animals kept in captivity. Have you ever looked closely to see how sad animals look in zoos? If you observe them carefully, you can even feel their sadness irrespective of how “well” the zoo has attempted to reproduce their natural habitat. But anyway, since we had nothing better to do, and since going in a group would help keep the costs low, we agreed to join the others.
