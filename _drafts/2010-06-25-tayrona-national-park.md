The Spaniard & I had planned to go to Parque Tayrona together, but since I had slept well past the agreed-upon time, he had left by the time I got ready. I reached the entrance to Tayrona National Park at about 11, and paid the entrance fee of 34000 Colombian pesos for non-Colombians. A mini-bus then drove me further into the park for about 15 minutes.

From where the bus dropped me, I began my long walk into the jungle. The jungle was beautiful and dense but it never seemed intimidating. This was probably because of the clear path all along and the constant human traffic. The only thing that was slowing me down and becoming a big pain in the neck was my extremely loose pair of shorts. I couldn’t even walk 20 steps without having to pull up my shorts. I had to do something about this, but since I had left my belt in my backpack back at the hostel in Santa Marta, I had to improvise. After some looking around I found a suitable looking creeper, chopped off a portion of it, and tied it around my waist. Everybody was giving me strange looks after that, but at least the solution worked!!

After walking for about 45 minutes, I reached the first beach called Arricefes. Here I rented a hammock for the night, put away my bag and went for a stroll on the beach. Presently I came upon a board that said “No trespassing beyond this point” or something to that effect. But the rocks behind the board looked beautiful so I trespassed beyond that point anyway, found myself a shady spot besides a huge boulder and started reading.

I realised I had crept off to a peaceful sleep when I was suddenly woken up by the sound of a helicopter flying at a low altitude towards me. The military guys within the chopper were staring at me as they flew past. I suddenly remembered the “no trespassing” sign and thought that I might get into trouble if I stuck around. So I scampered off in the opposite direction, found another superb spot to read and to observe the crabs on the beach.

At dusk I went back to the hostel and realised that I had been very foolish to not bring any insect repellent. The mosquitoes were already giving me a hard time, and at night it would only get worse. Thankfully there were two Dutch girls who agreed to let me use some of their insect repellent cream. But its effect wore off after a few hours, and combined with the fact that I wasn’t used to sleeping in hammocks; I had a terrible sleepless night.
