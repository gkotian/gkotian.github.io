title: Getting to New York

OJ left for work early in the morning after saying a quick goodbye, and a few hours later; I took a long, slow but scenic route to the airport. After returning the car, I went to the check-in counter and was told that my flight was delayed by more than 5 hours. I settled down for an all-too-familiar long wait but barely 30 minutes later there was an update - the flight had been officially canceled due to bad weather. The tradition of the Breakdown Gang was being upheld :)

They gave me an option of either getting a full refund or taking the next morning flight to New York. They also said that since it was due to bad weather, they won’t provide accommodation for me. I think if I had made a drama there, then I could have gotten a free place to stay, but “making a drama” is a skill that I haven’t yet acquired :(

So now my options were:

Take the flight the next morning, but I wasn’t getting free accommodation and there was no guarantee that the morning flight would be on time – reject. 
Rent a car and drive to New York, but the cheapest available car was for $365 per day – reject. 
Take some other flight to New York, but all flights had the same problem – reject. 
Take a flight to some other city (Boston/Washington/Philadelphia), and then figure out how to get to New York from there, but there were too many unknowns – reject. 
Luckily, Jana was online and I explained my problem to her, and she suggested a brilliant alternative of taking a bus that would leave from downtown Pittsburgh at half past midnight and reach Manhattan early in the morning. I booked it right away, and hired a shared van to take me downtown.

There was another Indian guy in the van, who was on an official trip to the US, and he just couldn’t stop complaining about the situation. All along the way he wailed about what a huge disaster it is that he would be reaching India 2 days late. But of course he wouldn’t have to spend even a penny more as his company was going to take care of it. In fact, he had already planned how he would dupe his company into paying him the full taxi fare, while he was taking this cheap shared van ride. Yes, people like this also inhabit the earth.
