After reaching Pittsburgh, I took a shared taxi to Cranberry Township to the address given by OJ, but as some part of me had already expected, that address simply didn’t exist. To make matters worse, I did not even have a phone number where I could reach OJ. Risking being caught for trespassing, I entered a random apartment block (luckily for me, the locking mechanism of the main door was broken), went down to the basement and discovered a luggage storage area (where again luckily for me, one closet was unlocked and empty). I kept my backpack there, locked it and went out to devise a backup plan.

There was a church close-by and I decided that if I couldn’t find OJ by nightfall, I would go to the church and sleep. Also nearby was a public library (yay for America!), so I could peacefully wait till evening.

In the evening, I went back towards the apartment block where I had kept my backpack, and surprise surprise, there was OJ walking towards me with some of his colleagues! We retrieved my backpack, and went home.
