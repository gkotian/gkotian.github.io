At Fort Lauderdale, I was expecting the usual long barrage of questions at immigrations, but it turned out to be surprisingly pleasant. The immigrations officer was impressed by my trip to South America, and only asked me questions about it. When asked which kind of food I liked the most, I replied without hesitation that none of them could even compare to Indian cuisine, which only seemed to make her even happier :)

I had a lot of time to kill before my flight to New York, so I went walking around the airport and discovered an absolutely stunning place to sit and watch the setting sun bathe the airport in its orange hue. Later I got some food to eat and settled myself on a bench with my book. A young guy on a bicycle approached me and asked if I had a cigarette. Luckily for him, I did – a pack of cigarettes bought in Delhi, and untouched for 4 months.

The next morning, I caught my flight to New York, and thanks to clear directions given by Navin, managed to reach Grove Street station in New Jersey. He came to pick me up, and it was great to see him after so long.

In the evening, Navin, Smitha & I went walking to the waterfront at New Jersey from where one can get a stunning view of the New York skyline. Later, we met their friends Anupa, Madhav & Shrikar for a few beers.

Shrikar & I met up the next day and went walking around Manhattan spending a long time chilling at Bryant Park and Times Square, and in the evening walked a long, long way to meet up with my old friend Jonathan Yevin. I had met Jon at a couchsurfing meeting in Bangalore, and he had surfed our couch for one night. Jon is a very interesting person who deserves an entire blog post for himself – coming soon!

Coming back to New York, Jon’s flatmate Sharon was celebrating her birthday; so Shrikar & I joined Jon, Sharon, Jon’s Panamanian friend Suzie and a few other people for a few beers.

This had been my second time in New York city, and in this trip, I had discovered it in a completely new light – one that made me want to stay for longer. But my flight to Pittsburgh was booked for very early morning the next day, and I had to leave Navin & Smitha’s home without getting a chance to say thank you to them. I hastily scribbled a thank you note, and quietly pulled the door closed behind me.
