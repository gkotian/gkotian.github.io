At some point during my constant travelling, I finished ...
(Traveling on the train from Mangalore to Goa gave me an opportunity to finish) the book I had been stuck with for the last month or so. I took so much time to finish it not because it was a boring book, but because I have become a slow reader (and that has happened because I have ignored my reading habit over the last few years).

Anyway, the book I just finished is called “Brave New World”, written by Aldous Huxley. It was written in the year X, and it is about how the author imagines the world would be many many years into the future. It was a fascinating read, since the author’s imagination is so believable. If one were to consider how human civilization has progressed from X to 2010, it seems like we are on the path to where Huxley imagined we would one day be.
