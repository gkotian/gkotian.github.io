From Delhi, I flew to Mumbai, then to Mangalore to meet Fox and my relatives, then to Bangalore to pack up all my stuff, then came back to Mangalore, then traveled to Goa to meet my parents, then to Mumbai to apply for the Russian visa, then to Nashik and Shirdi, and then back to Goa… All this when still recovering from jetlag and never staying for more than 2 days at one place!
