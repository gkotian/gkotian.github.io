rented Subaru Forester, drove to downtown Pittsburgh, beautiful city – great views from Mount Washington, saw firworks, chilled out at Firhouse lounge

OJ & I decided to rent a car and go on a trip over the weekend. At the car rental shop, we had to choose from two sedans and an SUV. Although the SUV – a Subaru Forester – was considerably dearer than the sedans, we simply had to go for it from the moment we feasted our eyes on it :)

That evening, we drove to the top of Mount Washington and saw what a beautiful city Pittsburgh really is. After struggling a bit to park the car in the city centre, we sat near one of the hundreds of bridges in the city and enjoyed the brilliant 4th of July fireworks.

Late in the evening, we went to the firehouse lounge and the **** to relax and get a feel for the nightlife in Pittsburgh.
