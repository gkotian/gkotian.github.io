After spending 25 days in Colombia, I left for the US on the last day when my visa would expire. The security checks at the airport were very stringent, particularly in my case. But I have accepted this as being part of having an Indian passport. Moreover, my terribly slow and totally lost meandering about with a blank look on my face probably causes people to suspect me even more.

After clearing security and immigration, I said goodbye to South America and boarded the plane to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

This trip to South America has lasted for just under 3 months, and I was able to cover just 2 countries – Ecuador & Colombia. But the volunteering experience in Ecuador, and the friendly people of Colombia have made it totally worth the time, money and effort spent. I regard Colombians as being almost as nice as the Turks. The Colombian tourism board says about Colombia, “The only risk is wanting to stay” and I can vouch for that.
