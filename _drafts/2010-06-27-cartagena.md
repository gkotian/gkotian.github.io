Cartagena is the city most visited by tourists in Colombia, and it was going to be my last city in South America (in this trip). I took the convenient door-to-door shuttle service between Santa Marta and Cartagena, and checked myself into a hostel.

The next 2 days were spent just relaxing and walking about the town. I met 2 Swedish girls Rose-Marie & Zaira in the hostel, and we went on the Rumba bus on one of the evenings, where we met an English guy called Rodney. The Rumba bus consists of a live band playing on a colourful chivas bus and people shouting inside. It looks like a lot of fun from the outside, but is not really all that fun from the inside. The 4 of us thought it was a big waste of money.

But Cartagena itself is a pretty town, and I spent 2 days walking the quaint inner streets, and the pretty waterfronts. Traveling through Colombia had been a superb experience, and Cartagena was the perfect way to say goodbye to this beautiful country with its wonderful people.
