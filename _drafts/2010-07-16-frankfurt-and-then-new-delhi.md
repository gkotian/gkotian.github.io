The flight landed in Frankfurt in the wee hours of the morning and I called Jana. It was frustrating that we were just 300 km away but still couldn’t meet. Time seemed to fly quickly at Frankfurt, and before long I was on my Air India flight to New Delhi.

I was warned that Air India is not so great, but my flight to Delhi was much better than the Lufthansa flight that had brought me to Frankfurt. 

After collecting my bags, I took a taxi straight to Punitha’s apartment and surprised her. Before this, I had cooked up a story about how some friend of mine called Sumit was coming to drop off a parcel. She had completely forgotten about that, and didn’t even recognise my voice when I called her from the security gate. In the end, it was a good surprise :)

One of Punitha’s flatmates was celebrating her birthday, and I made an appearance bang in the middle of the party. I don’t think the b’day girl liked it much that all the attention had suddenly shifted off from her :D
