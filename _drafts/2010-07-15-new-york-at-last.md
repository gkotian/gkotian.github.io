The bus was filled with people of Chinese origin, and I stuck out like a sore thumb. But as promised, it dropped me off early next morning in the middle of Chinatown in Manhattan. After having a quick breakfast, I decided that I would finally realise my long cherished dream – of walking across the Brooklyn bridge. I am told that “normal” people have long cherished dreams of owning an apartment with a view in one of the innumerable skyscrapers in this city. So what does this make me – abnormal? Lack of ambition, perhaps :)

So I began my walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn under a slight drizzle. Along the way, I spotted an umbrella that had been discarded in a trash bin. I had never picked stuff out of a trash can before, but I had a laptop to protect so I picked up the badly broken umbrella. Close to the other end of the bridge, the rain was showing signs of stopping so I discarded the umbrella – very bad idea! Hardly 5 minutes later, it started pouring like crazy and I was stuck with nowhere to hide. In my confusion, I ran in some random direction and managed to get lost.

It took some wet maps and some friendly passers-by to get me back on track, and after about half an hour, I was in a subway heading to John F Kennedy international airport.

A couple of hours later, I said goodbye to the United States of America yet again.
