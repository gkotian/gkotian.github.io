I would be flying from Pittsburgh to New York on Tuesday evening, and a taxi from Cranberry township to the airport would cost at least $40. But for $80, I could rent a car, use it the entire previous day and then return it at the airport itself; and that sounded like a rather good deal. So I reserved a car at the closest Avis location, which unfortunately was not close enough :( It was about 15 miles (X km) away in the next township of Wexford, and since I didn’t walk to hire a taxi to get there, I decided to walk it.

I left home at noon, and had lunch at a nearby Indian restaurant called “Flavor of India”. If you ever go on such a long walk anywhere in the US, you’ll understand just how unfriendly the country is towards pedestrians. All along the way, I saw many boards that said “no pedestrians”, but there was no alternate path either. So once you come to a 4-way “no pedestrians” intersection, you have no other choice but to turn back the way you came. This was not an option for me, so I broke that “law” a few times along my journey to Wexford.

The US may have a President of African origin, but outside of the big cities, many Americans are still racist. Some may argue that “racist” is a strong term to use, but if you were to have to listen to people in cars slowing down, rolling down their windows, abusing you and calling you a terrorist before driving away, then maybe you’ll change your mind. This had become a rather common occurrence with OJ and his colleagues, because of which they were always hesitant to step out of their homes even to go and buy groceries. So when I was walking to Wexford, I had mentally prepared myself for somebody hurling abuses at me and calling me a terrorist. What I hadn’t prepared for and did not expect the least bit was a half full glass of a soft drink being hurled at me from a passing car. I was lucky that it missed me by a few inches or else it would have hurt – probably more emotionally than physically :( Come on, I am not an illegal immigrant in this country; in fact, I wouldn’t stay for even one day more than I need to, because it is so damn expensive. I guess when one has been travelling through places like Turkey and Colombia where people are so friendly, one just expects too much.

After escaping from the soda missile, I continued my long walk, and finally at 4 pm I was at Avis! Within 10 minutes, I was inside a red Hyundai Elantra, and in almost no time, I was back home.

In the evening, after a game of cricket; OJ, Vikas, Shrikar & I went to downtown Pittsburgh and partied late into the night.
