Thanks to the damned mosquitoes, I could hardly sleep and was up and about at 4.30. Besides being rather rude (very unlike most Colombians), the hostel staff had not bothered to place any toilet paper in the restrooms. I have noticed that people near the coasts tend to be generally unfriendly (going by the beaches in Goa, the Pacific coast in Ecuador and now the Caribbean coast in Colombia). I don’t know if this is due to the abundance of tourists or due to some other reason, but that is beside the point.

So I started my early morning walk from Arricefes to some of the other beaches of Tayrona through some small stretches of forest between them. As I walked, the coastline seemed to be getting prettier, and being devoid of tourists at this early hour, I was able to get some good pictures.

In a while I came to Cabo del San Guia which was just stunningly beautiful. If I’d known about this place before, I would have stayed here rather than at Arricefes.

After walking for about 30 minutes more, I came to another forested section, but my sixth sense told me not to enter; and I always listen to my subconscious mind. Since there was not a soul for miles around, I decided to strip off my clothes and feel one with nature. But since my tattoo had still not healed completely, I couldn’t go for a swim :(

The rest of the morning was spent in reading in shady spots along the beach and slowly making my way back to Arricefes. As I was having lunch, somebody tapped me on my shoulder and called me by name. It was the Peruvian girl I had met while waiting for the big accident site to be cleared (the one who reminded me of Smita Raman). But I did not want to stay in Tayrona for much longer, so after lunch I said goodbye to her and started my return journey walking through the forest at first, and then taking the bus ride back to Santa Marta.
