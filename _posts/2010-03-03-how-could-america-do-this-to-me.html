<p>I had been to the US twice before on work and lived there for a considerable amount of time. When I returned the first time, they detached the departure card (I-94); but left it there on my second departure.</p>
<p>I didn’t think it would be an issue at all, but during some random conversations with fellow travelers and their experiences at American immigrations, I wasn’t so sure. So I read about it a little online, and it appeared as though it could be a problem after all. So I thought I’d clear things up at the American Embassy at Hanoi, and got there early in the morning.</p>
<p>The security at the embassy didn’t let me speak to any official, and asked me to go to the American consulate a few streets away. Guards at the consulate were no better. I was refused entry because I was neither Vietnamese nor American. I explained my problem to the security guy who spoke to someone inside, and said that everything was alright and I could go to the US with no worries.</p>
<p>So would I fly to the US on the assurance of a guard that there would be no problems? No ****ing way!!!!<br />
So I went online once again, and sent e-mails to the American consulates both in Hanoi and in Chennai. The Chennai guys were quick and I got a reply within an hour. It was indeed a problem but I could go to the US if I could sufficiently prove that I didn’t overstay in the US. All the necessary documents for this were in Bangalore.</p>
<p>So now I had 2 choices:<br />
1. Postpone my flight to the US, ask Shaarad to courier the documents and fly to the US<br />
2. Go back to India and then think about the next plan of action</p>
<p>Option 1 involved hardly any monetary loss, but option 2 was what I really wanted. So here I am – 5 pm Vietnam time – tickets to San Francisco canceled – tickets from Hanoi to Bangkok and then Bangkok to New Delhi bought – total loss about 30,000 Rupees – happiness in my heart, priceless!</p>
