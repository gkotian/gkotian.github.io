<p>Note: In this post, Football =&gt; Soccer. In the part of the world that I come from, football is called so because the feet are used to kick it, and not because the length of the ball is one foot!</p>
<p>As I was walking along the beach, I saw a group of guys playing football. Normally I would have asked them if I could join them, but for some reason I didn’t (maybe in the back of my mind I was thinking of the time I had my expensive sunglasses stolen while playing football on Palolem beach in Goa with a bunch of strangers). In a while, a police jeep came by carrying even more guys.</p>
<p>But the two teams didn’t have the same number of players, so they were looking expectantly at me. That was more than enough invitation for me to run up, place my bag in the police jeep and join in. The guys were as surprised as any normal Ecuadorian to find out that I had come from almost exactly the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>Now I must say here that I’m a decent football player, and on my day, I can give the best of them a run for their money. As a new-player-test, I was passed the ball early on, and in my eagerness to impress, I completely botched it up. It took me a long time after that to prove my worth.</p>
<p>Presently, other regular players came along, and the teams were imbalanced again. According to me, when people are playing casual football on a beach; having 8 players in one team and 9 in the other hardly makes a difference. But this was not an opinion shared by one of the players of the opposing side, who started making a big issue of our side having an extra player. An awkward silence followed, and to save somebody the embarrassment of asking me to leave; I volunteered to leave myself. But before going, I made sure to thank the guys for giving me an opportunity to play with them.</p>
