<p>On the way back from Tena, our bus dropped us very close to the bridge in Baños from where one could jump off the edge suspended by bungee cords, for a mere $10. I had always wanted to do a bungee jump, and couldn’t wait. Abraham had already done it twice before, and he was ready for more. Nicolas &amp; Pedro didn’t want to, so they were in charge of capturing our jumps.</p>
<p>Abraham went first and jumped backwards. The whole setup looked pretty safe, so I was almost unafraid. I would have liked to jump forward with the ground rushing toward me, but my harness had already been fixed for a backward jump, so I went ahead with it.</p>
<p>Here I will digress. I am writing this post sitting in a small classroom in the school, and I could hear something that didn’t quite fit in. Since I was lost in my thoughts, it took me a while to realise that it was a Hindi song playing faintly somewhere. As soon as it struck me, I rushed outside to find the kids dancing to “Bole chudiyan, bole kangana” from the movie “Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham”. It was anything but my favourite song, but it was still a pleasant surprise to hear it playing on the other side of the World!!</p>
<p>Coming back to the topic, I jumped backwards facing the sky and fell freely for about 2 to 3 seconds maybe, after which the cords tightened around me. I was seeing stars and it took some time to get my orientation right. After that, I swung around suspended in mid air for about 5 minutes while they gently lowered me down to the ground.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been a real bungee jump where one is tied only at the ankles, but for a fraction of the cost, it had been a good experience.</p>
